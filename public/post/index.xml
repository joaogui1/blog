      <description>JAX é uma nova biblioteca para Python da Google com foco em pesquisa de alta performance em Aprendizado de Máquina e seguindo o paradigma de programação funcional Mais especificamente JAX nos dá acesso a uma API compatível com numpy e scipy e transformações de função, as principais sendo grad, jit, vmap e pmap(que vai ter seu próprio post no futuro).
O Wrapper de Numpy: jax.numpy JAX nos dá acesso ao jax.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m a Brazilian undergraduate student in Computer Science and I spent the past 3 months in the University of Tsukuba doing a research internship under Professor Claus Aranha. Here I will talk about my project during these past months to the best of my memory and in the end write down some lessons learned.
The research idea Softbot Design Soft robots (softbots) are robots built from highly compliant materials, similar to those found in living organisms1.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer, I&amp;rsquo;m far from a legend at competitive programming, I&amp;rsquo;m blue on codeforces and I will participate on IOI, I believe though that I know enough about CP and teaching that I can make some contribution
When you ask on forums about becoming red in codeforces, topcoder or atcode or how to get a gold medal in IOI, most people just say things like &amp;ldquo;practice, practice, practice&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;solve as many problems as you can&amp;rdquo;, but while this is better than nothing, it&amp;rsquo;s not the whole truth and is in fact a quite inefficient way to train.</description>
